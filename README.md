Capital Guesser Game


The Capital Guesser Game is a simple Python learning project that prompts the user to guess the capital of a U.S. state. The game uses a dictionary of state capitals and keeps track of statistics for each state, such as the number of correct and wrong answers.

Usage: 
To play the game, run the capitals.py file in a Python environment. The game will prompt you to guess the capital of a randomly chosen state, and provide feedback on whether your answer is correct or wrong. Once you have gone through all 50 states, the game will ask if you want to play again.

Future Improvements: 
In future versions, the Capital Guesser Game will be improved by implementing the Google Maps API. This will allow the game to display a map of the state along with the capital, and provide additional educational information about the state.
